# Classic Arcade Game Clone Project


## Background

This project is an attempt to recreate a version of a classic arcade game Frogger.
The png files and game engine were originally furnished by Udacity's Team, notably by Andrew Wong.


## Instructions

Click on this link https://call900913.github.io/fend-rchristy-project3/ to play the game.

Or, if you prefer, you can visit this link https://github.com/call900913/fend-rchristy-project3 and click on the green `Clone or download` button to download the file into your machine.

Once you have the project folder in your machine, navigate to its root directory from your Terminal or Command Line app.
An easy way to do that if your machine runs on OSX is to open your Terminal, type in `cd `, then drag and drop the project folder from the Finder window where that folder is located.

In the root directory of the project (if you type `ls`, you should see the `index.html` file in the list), open `index.html`  with your browser of choice.
If you're on a Mac, type `open -a 'Firefox' index.html`. You can substitute `Firefox` with the name of your favorite browser.


## How to Play

You can move the player by using the arrow keys on your keyboard.

The objective is to get the player to the water in the northern-most part of the canvas without getting hit by any bug.

If the player is hit by a bug, the game resets the player's location to its initial position.



Cheers!
