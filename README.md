## Background

This project is an attempt to recreate a version of a classic arcade game Frogger.
The png files and game engine were originally furnished by Udacity's Team, notably by Andrew Wong.


## Instructions

Click on this link https://call900913.github.io/fend-rchristy-project3/ to play the game.


You can move the player by using the arrow keys on your keyboard.

The objective is to get the player to the water in the northern-most part of the canvas without getting hit by any bug.

If the player is hit by a bug, the game resets the player's location to its initial position.






Cheers!
